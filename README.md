# Media Log

This is the back-end to my Discord Media Logger.  Created with Python and the Django framework, connected to a React front-end and a Python Discord bot.

The purpose of this project was to add some functionality to the group Discord chat for me and some friends.

The primary function was to make a log of all of the different media that was posted (e.g. YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify) so that we could search and sort through the data with an interface.
